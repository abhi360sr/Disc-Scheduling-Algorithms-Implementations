# Disk Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of six popular disk scheduling algorithms used in operating systems and computer systems. Disk scheduling algorithms optimize the order of accessing disk blocks to minimize seek time and improve overall system performance.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
   - Processes requests in the order they arrive.
  
2. **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**
   - Services the request that is closest to the current head position.

3. **SCAN**
   - Moves the disk arm in one direction servicing requests until the end and then reverses direction.

4. **C-SCAN**
   - Similar to SCAN but only moves in one direction and jumps to the beginning of the disk when reaching the end.

5. **LOOK**
   - Services requests in the direction of the closest one and reverses direction when no more requests are in that direction.

6. **C-LOOK**
   - Similar to LOOK but only moves in one direction and jumps to the beginning of the disk when reaching the end.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in C programming language and can be compiled and run on any system that supports C compilation.

### Running the Algorithms

1. Compile the source code using a C compiler (`gcc` recommended):
   ```
   gcc fcfs.c -o fcfs
   gcc sstf.c -o sstf
   gcc scan.c -o scan
   gcc cscan.c -o cscan
   gcc look.c -o look
   gcc clook.c -o clook
   ```

2. Execute each program with appropriate input (number of disk requests, requests themselves, and initial head position):
   ```
   ./fcfs
   ./sstf
   ./scan
   ./cscan
   ./look
   ./clook
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter input values and observe the sequence of disk accesses along with total seek time for each algorithm.

## Example

Suppose we have the following disk requests: 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67. Running each algorithm with these requests will demonstrate how each algorithm optimizes the order of disk accesses and calculates seek times.
